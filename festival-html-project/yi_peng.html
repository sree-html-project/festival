    <p>Yi Peng’s roots trace back to the Lanna Kingdom, a historic region in northern Thailand. The festival is renowned for its spectacular display of floating lanterns, or khom loy, which are released into the night sky. These lanterns, made of paper and fueled by a small flame, symbolize the release of past misfortunes and the ushering in of new hopes and dreams. The sight of thousands of these lanterns ascending into the sky is both enchanting and spiritually significant, representing the illumination of one’s path and the cleansing of past negativity.</p>
    
   <p> In Chiang Mai, the festival is celebrated with exceptional fervor. The city’s rivers and streets are adorned with floating krathongs—small, decorative rafts made from banana leaves, flowers, and candles. These are set afloat on water as offerings to the goddess of water, seeking blessings and good fortune for the year ahead.</p>
    
    <p>Yi Peng also features traditional Lanna music, dance, and vibrant parades. Visitors can experience local crafts and delicacies, adding to the festive atmosphere. The festival fosters a deep sense of community and reflection, allowing both locals and tourists to engage with Thai culture and traditions.</p>
    
    <p>In recent years, Yi Peng has gained international acclaim, drawing visitors from around the globe to witness its captivating beauty and cultural richness.</P>
